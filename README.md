## 🧩 Fun Facts (and how they help my data work)
- **NYT Sunday Crossword** — persistence + pattern recognition; great for debugging and feature ideation.  
- **Runner & Zumba fan** — consistency and discipline; I approach model iteration the same way: steady, measurable progress.  
- **Trivia teammate** — fast recall and collaborative problem-solving; useful in cross-functional discussions and quick analyses.  
- **Fine Arts background** — composition and visual storytelling translate to clear charts and stakeholder-friendly narratives.
